# VSCode Copilot Ignore

This is my way of solving [Copilot Discussion #10305 .copilotignore support](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/10305) while waiting for official support.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description
The VSCode Copilot Ignore extension enhances your Visual Studio Code experience by allowing you to specify files and directories where GitHub Copilot should be disabled. This helps you customize the Copilot suggestions to only focus on code you want assistance with.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Patterns of multiple .copilotignore files will simply be concatenated into one list of patterns.

Meaning the .copilotignore file does not work recursively based on its own path yet (like other .ignore files).

## ‚úÖ Features
**Ignore file:** Create a .copilotignore file in the root of a workspace to specify patterns of files and directories.
If any file matching a pattern is open in VS Code, Copilot will be disabled.
(This includes files open outside the current active text editor)

**Reactive**: Changes made to the .copilotignore file(s) are immediately reflected.

# üìã To do list

- [x] Create a working proof of concept for .copilotignore
- [x] Make .copilotignore file change trigger a reload of patterns
- [ ] Upload the extension to Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- [ ] Make .copilotignore take into account it's own path/location (apply patterns recursive)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- Create a .copilotignore file in **the root of your workspace**.
- Specify the file patterns, directories, or files that you want Copilot to ignore in the .copilotignore file.
- Save the file, and Copilot will adapt its suggestions accordingly.


# üîß Build/Install from source
- Clone git repository
- Edit src/extension.ts as needed
- Run ``npm run build```
- Install the copilotignore-X.X.X.vsix file through vscode (right click install Extension VSIX)
